# minikube-cluster
Deploy minikube using terraform


## About
This project shows a simple example of running a minikube cluster localy using terraform. Note some of the configuration may need to be adjusted for your use case.

## Warning
This is an example project and not production ready. Certain configurations like argocd is running as TLS disabled.

## Dependencies

* Uses docker for the VM - could use podman in the future.
* Need to have minikube and kubectl installed.
* Assumes minikube is running ```minikube start```
* Assumes this alias is setup ```kubectl='minikube -p minikube kubectl --'```
* Assumes docker desktop is running.

## To Run
You only need to run the make clean command if you want to start from scratch:

### 1. Use these make commands:
```sh
make clean
```

### 2. Install all:
```sh
make all
```

If it is successfully running you should see the minikube start/delete command. This was added to fix an error about minikube not running. Terraform init and plan to setup terraform. Then some terraform output to apply the tf files. Note the terraform apply might fail. 

```sh
minikube start --cpus 8 --memory 16384 --kubernetes-version v1.30.5 && \
	minikube delete

### Is you see this error
```sh
│ Error: argocd/quay.io failed to create kubernetes rest client for update of resource: Get "http://localhost/api?timeout=32s": dial tcp [::1]:80: connect: connection refused
│
│   with kubectl_manifest.argocd-manifests[2],
│   on argocd.tf line 19, in resource "kubectl_manifest" "argocd-manifests":
│   19: resource "kubectl_manifest" "argocd-manifests" {
```
The you need to run ```sh make terraform-apply ```

It should re-apply the argocd manifests as it takes some time for argocd to be up and running.

## Accessing the cluster
Assuming terraform went well. To access the services run this script to port forward to localhost:
```sh
./setup_dev.sh
```
## Argocd will be created with admin user and an autogenerated secret.
```sh
kubectl -n argocd get secret argocd-initial-admin-secret -o jsonpath="{.data.password}" | base64 -d; echo
```
